# GitHub Actions Research Summary

## Research Question: Does GitHub Actions Support "Stages"?

**Answer**: GitHub Actions does NOT have a dedicated "stages" keyword like some other CI/CD systems (e.g., GitLab CI, Azure DevOps). However, it achieves the same functionality through **job dependencies** and **reusable workflows**.

## How GitHub Actions Implements "Stages"

### 1. Job Dependencies (`needs` keyword)
- Jobs can depend on other jobs using the `needs` keyword
- Dependent jobs only run if their prerequisites complete successfully
- Creates sequential execution: `job1` → `job2` → `job3`

Example:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Running tests"
  
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test  # Only runs if 'test' succeeds
    steps:
      - run: echo "Deploying"
```

### 2. Reusable Workflows (`workflow_call`)
- Workflows can be called by other workflows
- Use `workflow_call` trigger to make a workflow reusable
- Call with `uses: ./.github/workflows/workflow-name.yml`

Example:
```yaml
# Reusable workflow (test.yml)
on:
  workflow_call:

# Calling workflow
jobs:
  test:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/test.yml
  deploy:
    needs: test
```

### 3. Sequential Execution
- By default, jobs run in parallel
- Use `needs` to create sequential execution chains
- Failed jobs stop the dependency chain

## Our Implementation

### Current Architecture:
```
Test Stage (test-and-build.yml)
├── Trigger: push, pull_request, workflow_call
├── Matrix: Multiple OS + Python versions  
└── Tests: MCP server + Node.js wrapper

Deploy Stage (triggered on release)
├── deploy-pypi.yml (needs: test)
├── deploy-npm.yml (needs: test)
└── docker-deploy.yml (needs: test)
```

### Key Features:
1. **Reusable Test Workflow**: `test-and-build.yml` supports `workflow_call`
2. **Deploy Dependencies**: All deploy workflows call the test workflow first
3. **Independent Deployments**: Each deployment type is separate and independent
4. **Failure Isolation**: If tests fail, no deployments run

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Modularity**: Each workflow has a single responsibility
2. **Reliability**: Deployments only run after tests pass
3. **Efficiency**: Reuses test workflow, avoids duplication
4. **Flexibility**: Can deploy to specific registries independently
5. **Maintainability**: Easy to modify or add new deployment targets
6. **Visibility**: Clear dependency graph in GitHub UI

## Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: Single Workflow with Multiple Jobs
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps: [...]
  
  deploy-pypi:
    needs: test
    steps: [...]
  
  deploy-npm:
    needs: test  
    steps: [...]
```

**Pros**: Single file, simpler structure
**Cons**: Large file, less modular, harder to maintain

### Option 2: Separate Workflows with Duplicated Tests
```yaml
# Each deploy workflow runs its own tests
jobs:
  test:
    steps: [... duplicate test code ...]
  deploy:
    needs: test
    steps: [...]
```

**Pros**: Self-contained workflows
**Cons**: Code duplication, slower CI, maintenance overhead

### Option 3: Manual Dependencies (workflow_run)
```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["Test"]
    types: [completed]
```

**Pros**: Can trigger across different repos
**Cons**: Complex, harder to debug, less reliable

## Conclusion

Our chosen approach (reusable workflows with job dependencies) follows GitHub Actions best practices and provides:

- ✅ **Clear "stages"** through job dependencies
- ✅ **Modular architecture** through workflow separation  
- ✅ **Code reuse** through `workflow_call`
- ✅ **Reliable deployments** through test dependencies
- ✅ **Independent releases** through separate deploy workflows

This is the **recommended pattern** for complex CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions.

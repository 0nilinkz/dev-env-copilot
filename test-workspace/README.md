# Test Workspace

This is a test workspace to verify the Dev Environment Copilot extension works correctly.

## Project Structure
- Node.js project with package.json
- Python dependencies in requirements.txt
- Docker setup
- Mixed technology stack for comprehensive testing

## Testing the Extension

1. Use `@devenv` to test environment detection and setup
2. Use `@devproj` to test project analysis  
3. Use `@devsec` to test security scanning

The plugin architecture should enable inter-plugin communication and event-driven workflows.
